React homework 1. 

Welcome to my very first stop using React.js. This Read me is not going to be very long, apologize for that, but well the project itself it is very simple.

This project was built to master the useState and useEffect interactive rendering properties, how  to use, import and export components to help keep a clean code along with some javascript logic behind the ramdomazing of the results shown. 

For this to be completed I had an array of objects, with in those objects I had quotes and the authors of those quotes, my task was to iterate through them, and getting each one rendered  in a random way, while also changing the font, background, button and quotation symbols colors with each new rendering of random quotes. Side note thanks to https://boxicons.com/ for the quotation icons. 

Thank you for reading this.
